# Hungarian-Method

The Hungarian method is a combinatorial optimization algorithm that solves the assignment problem in polynomial time and which anticipated later primal–dual methods. It was developed and published in 1955 by Harold Kuhn, who gave the name "Hungarian method" because the algorithm was largely based on the earlier works of two Hungarian mathematicians: Dénes Kőnig and Jenő Egerváry.

In this simple example there are three workers: Paul, Dave, and Chris. One of them has to clean the bathroom, another sweep the floors and the third washes the windows, but they each demand different pay for the various tasks. The problem is to find the lowest-cost way to assign the jobs. The problem can be represented in a matrix of the costs of the workers doing the jobs. For example:

The Hungarian method, when applied to the above table, would give the minimum cost: this is $6, achieved by having Paul clean the bathroom, Dave sweep the floors, and Chris wash the windows.

All of the information about the project is located in the project documentation pdf file. The project can be run via any Python IDE.
